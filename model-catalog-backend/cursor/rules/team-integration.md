# Team Workflows

## Code Review Process
1. Developer writes code (with/without LLM)
2. Ask LLM: "Review this code for security, performance, and maintainability issues"
3. Address findings
4. Human peer review
5. Merge

## Documentation
After implementing a feature:
- Ask LLM: "Generate API documentation for this code"
- Ask LLM: "Write a README section explaining how to use this feature"
- Review and adjust for accuracy

## Knowledge Sharing
Weekly ritual:
- Each team member shares one useful LLM interaction
- Discuss what worked, what didn't
- Update these guidelines based on learnings

## Onboarding New Members
New team members should:
1. Read these guidelines
2. Practice with 3 sample tasks using LLM
3. Pair with experienced member on first real task
4. Share feedback on guidelines after 2 weeks
